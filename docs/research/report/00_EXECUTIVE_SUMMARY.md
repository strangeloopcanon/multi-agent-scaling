# Executive Summary: Agent Economy Phase II Evaluation

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Scope:** 50-task analysis set from SWE-bench Lite (first 50 manifest slots, with one deterministic replacement after strict preflight failure)

## The Core Thesis

The primary goal of Phase II was to test whether a multi-agent market with economic allocation and retry-exclusion could outperform the strongest individual frontier model on a level playing field.

The results provide directional evidence for this hypothesis: **the market beats the best solo model by 10 absolute percentage points (58% vs 48%) on identical scaffolds.** On this 50-task sample, the paired McNemar exact test is not yet conventionally significant (two-sided `p=0.3323`).

## Headline Results

We evaluated 50 tasks across four paradigms to isolate the value of the market mechanism from the noise of the scaffold:

| Execution Paradigm | Pass Rate | Absolute Passes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Market (Our Scaffold)** | **58.0%** | 29 / 50 |
| **Solo GPT-5.2 (Our Scaffold)** | **48.0%** | 24 / 50 |
| *Solo GPT-5.2 (External Scaffold)* | *74.0%* | 37 / 50 |
| *Oracle Ceiling (External Scaffold)* | *84.0%* | 42 / 50 |

*(External Scaffold denotes standard SWE-bench setups with interactive shells, test feedback, and multi-turn iteration).*

## Key Drivers of Success

1. **The Retry + Exclusion Mechanism is the Engine**
   Of the 29 market passes, 11 (38%) came on the second attempt. Without retries, the market would sit at 36%, below the solo model. The hard exclusion rule (a failed worker cannot rebid on the same task) forces model diversity on the second attempt, producing 11 rescues that single models missed.

2. **Model Diversity Adds Measurable Value**
   In a direct head-to-head comparison on these 50 tasks, the market solved 11 tasks that Solo GPT-5.2 failed, while Solo GPT-5.2 solved only 6 tasks that the market missed. This diversity effect concentrates in symbolic reasoning domains (e.g., `sympy`), where failures are model-specific rather than universal.

## The Remaining Bottlenecks

While the market outperforms single models, it currently sits below the theoretical Oracle Ceiling (84%) due to two primary constraints:

1. **The Scaffold Gap (The Ceiling)**
   Our single-shot, raw-diff execution environment imposes a ~26 percentage point penalty compared to interactive external scaffolds (48% vs 74% for GPT-5.2). The market recovers about 5 tasks (~10pp) of this lost capability through diversity, but the rest remains blocked without scaffold upgrades (test feedback, file-editing tools).

2. **Allocation Inefficiency (The Missed Upside)**
   The market's first-attempt allocation is poor. The scoring formula (`p_success * bounty - ask`) over-weights self-assessed confidence, allowing weaker but overconfident models (like GPT-5-mini, converting at 10%) to steal assignments from stronger models (like GPT-5.2, converting at 33%). Fixing bid calibration is the highest-leverage next step for the market mechanism itself.

## Conclusion

On this 50-task sample, the market shows a practical gain over the strongest same-scaffold solo baseline. Future improvements should focus on bid calibration and assignment scoring to capture more oracle upside, followed by incremental scaffold enhancements.
